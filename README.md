# React App Boilerplate

This React app boilerplate includes a set of commonly used libraries and patterns to help you get started with your next React project quickly.

## Features

- **React Query** for data fetching and caching.
- **Context API** as a global state management solution instead of Redux.
- **Material-UI** as a UI component library.
- **Emotion** for styling components with CSS-in-JS.

## Getting Started

To get started with this boilerplate, simply clone this repository and install the dependencies:


Once the installation is complete, you can start the development server:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
cd your-project
npm install


Once the installation is complete, you can start the development server:

npm start


This will open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000/`. Any changes you make to the code will be hot-reloaded automatically.

To build the app for production, use the following command:

npm run build


This will create an optimized production build in the `build` directory.

## Usage

This boilerplate includes a simple example of how to use React Query and the Context API together to manage global state.

The `src` directory contains the following files and directories:

- `components`: This directory contains reusable UI components.
- `contexts`: This directory contains the context providers and consumers.
- `hooks`: This directory contains custom hooks for interacting with React Query.
- `pages`: This directory contains the main pages of the app.
- `App.js`: This is the main component that renders the app.
- `index.js`: This is the entry point of the app.

To add a new page to the app, create a new file in the `pages` directory and import it into `App.js`. To add a new component, create a new file in the `components` directory and import it into the appropriate page.

You can modify the global state by using the provided context providers and consumers in the `contexts` directory. To interact with the server-side data, you can use the custom hooks provided in the `hooks` directory.

## Customization

This boilerplate is meant to be a starting point for your project and can be customized to fit your needs. Here are some suggestions for customizing the boilerplate:

- Replace Material-UI with your preferred UI library or write your own styles with Emotion.
- Replace the Context API with Redux or another state management solution.
- Add new pages, components, and hooks to the app.
- Modify the example server-side API calls in the hooks to match your own API.
